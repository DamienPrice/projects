# Ideal HRG Model Pressures Generator
This code generates a specific kind of pressure data using particle and chemical potential data with a mathematical formula. Physics aside, the computational success of the code is that the results are more accurate and precise than other versions and the run time is 10x faster than conventional iterative processes. 

## How to use
This repo has both .py and .ipynb versions of the code. Run either to your preference. They are, however, currently set to take in demo versions of data. The demo versions are significantly reduced versions as the original versions will require 16,433,143 arrangements. The original data files are found in /full_data.
