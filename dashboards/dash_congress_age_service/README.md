# A Dashboard on Congress Age and Length of Service

Data used for this dashboard comes from [FiveThirtyEight: Our Data](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/), and specifically from [FiveThirtyEight: Congress Demographics](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/congress-demographics)

This is a dashboard exploring statistics in Congress age and length of service from 1919 to 2023. I wanted to see if specific trends are happening for varying groups of Congress over time in terms of 
- average age, 
- age distribution, 
- age difference of the interquartile range, 
- length of total service for each group (i.e. total congresses served), and
- average service of all Congress over time.

The dashboard allows the user to view different groups of Congress such as all of Congress or just the House or just the Republicans.
